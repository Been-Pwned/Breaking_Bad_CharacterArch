            <p class="articletext">As mentioned in Hanks bio section he is extremely confident perhaps on the verge of arragant at the start of the series. He works for the DEA and is surprisingly competent. He develops through the series and has new experiences mostly involving panic attacks. So let's delve into this intersting character and bear of a man.</p><br>
            <p class="articletext"> Hank Shrader is on top of his world. He has a great job, great family, and is very competent. He has always been the <i>cool uncle</i> which on ocasion makes Walt jealous of him. He is a ruler in actions and confidence alone. He also serves as a heral and threshold gaurdian. The interesting thing about Hank is that he feels at home in the action. The heat of the battle. He survives numerous attacks and occasions that should have otherwise killed him. His downfall lays with a promotion in his job and struggles with his wife.(Skylers sister) From an outward view Hank likes to be seen as a strong, confident man, but on the inside is a cracking shell.</p><br>

                <img src="assets/imgs/outfittedhank.jpg" class="scaledimage">
                <i><figcaption>Hank fully outfitted and ready to use both brains and brawn</figcaption></i>
            </center>
            <p class="articletext">With Hank's many accomplishments he naturally is offered a promotion and where battles fail to stress him promotions do. He has a new experience... a panic attack. This jeaporadizes his unbeatable facade. He begins to feel like an imposter. He is probabbly the most skilled detective that the Albequrque DEA has. He is the only one that begins to catch on to Walter's empire. Where he starts the show a small bit of comic relief he ends the show as the only remaing enemy to Walter.</p><br>
            <p class="articletext">His archetypes are primarily; the herald, the threshold gaurdian, and the caregiver. He is an extremely complex character and even though when it comes to archetypes he stays pretty much the same. His actual character changes throughout the series as his life is consumed more and more by his case involving Walter... </p><br><br>

            <p> I'll repeat what I said with Jesse. This short little article doesn't do him justice.</p>
