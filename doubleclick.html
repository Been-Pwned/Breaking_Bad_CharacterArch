            -->
            <h2> The First Cooks </h2><br>

            <p class="articletext">Walter is an exquiste character for the purpose of showing the heroes journey. He adapts and evolves throughout the entirety of the series Breaking Bad. His development however, has a twist throughout the story he becomes more akin to a villain. The way in which the story represents him is intricate and extremely debatable. Therefore, this is simply my interpretation. Some may argue he doesn't become a villain at all, however the directors casting and most viewers emotions lead me the conclusion that he does. So join me as I explain his journey and fortell his future.<br> WARNING: SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT</p><br>
            
            <p class="articletext"> Walter White starts as a kindly and afable high school teacher. This would put him in the status quo section of the heroes journey. His call to adventure is quite literally a deathly one. His call is a diagnosis of lung cancer. Walter is understandably confused and upset with the world, as he has never smoked a day in his life. This call to adventure will haunt him throughout the series and shape the rest of his life. It is a hallmark for greater things and a calling for him to take control of his life. You see, for most of his life Walter has been pushed around by everyone around him, but with so little runway left he can't allow that to happen anymore...</p><br>
            
            <p class="articletext"> The assitance section of the heroes journey is a difficult part of Walt's journey to explain. This is because while he has many people he can rely on, he chooses to refrain from telling anyone of his ailment for quite some time. The majority of his aid comes from his own will forged by necessity. He begins to become bolder and even decides to join Hank on a call to a house where they are cooking <b>methanphetamine</b>. This is where he finds his true early-series assitance, Jesse Pinkman. However, Walter's journey is a long and ardous one. The only true friend he has for the majority of the series is his money and decaying lifespan. He is a character built of necessity and though his diagnosis of cancer is horrific it is also a primary aspect of his assitance. It is what drives him forward towards a darker path. </p>

            <i><figcaption> Walter being walked over by his chemistry students.</figcaption></i>
            </center><br>
            
            <p class="articletext"> At this point in the story Walt is an extremely incompetent criminal. The only thing he knows is chemistry. He must find a way to make money and his course of action to do this is to cook methanphetamine. He uses Jesse as his guide into the criminal underworld. This is where Walter makes his first jump into the "special world".(His departure) His unrivaled skill in chemistry quickly propels him to the forefront of most criminals and even grants him the FDA's attention. His brother-and-law Hank being part of said FDA. It is at this point that he faces his first trials and tribulations.</p><br>

            <p class="articletext"> There are many points in the series that are something of a turning point for Walt's identity. One of the most important of these moments happens in the first few episodes. This moment being when he strangles Crazy-8 a early-show antagonist. After a few weeks of holding him in their basement and burning his firends body in acid. Walter is forced to strangle him to survive. This is one of the earliest moments in the series where Walter is forced to consider the harshness of life. Walter as a primarily innocent and well-meaning character must have his moral compass worn down over time. There is no singular moment that breaks him entirely. It is a marathon of moral degratdation and realization. That is part of the intrigue of Breaking Bad you watch him change slowly over a year. This makes it more realisitc because of this I will be speaking of many moments in the series that change him the most.<p> <br>
            <p class="articletext"> Another primary moment of the first season is when his family attempts to force him to accept cancer treatment. This moment is one of the first moments in the series where he shows himself begining to gain confidence. His family sits him down shortly after he tells them of his cancer diagnosis. Skyler is at the forfront of this conversation making use of a "talking pillow". She wants Walter to get treatment at any costs. Walter refuses for one of the first times in his life and yet the rest of the family persisits. Based on some facial shots and points of tension in his voice a this point he feels betrayed feeling like his family has turned on him and is trying to force to do something he doesn't want to do. This is also an early moment in the series when he realizes how little control he has had in the past. For most of the first few seasons Walter's newfoun confidence and  control seem like a beneficial factor. It allows him to defend his kid Walter Jr. and he even begins to feel better about his life. </p><br>

            </center><br>

            <p class="articletext">Now that some major trials have been represented I will move on to some of the most early-series stress points. Jesse is injured by Tuco Salamanca which forces Walter to confront him. This point and additional points involving Tuco lead up to the Crisis or Nadar of the first few seasons. </p><br>

            <p class="articletext">The major crisis of the first few seasons is one that had major buildup. It is a moment of great importance and tension. Both Jesse and Walter have been looking for way out of partnership with a crazy drug lord. Tuco Salamanca. After many fiascos and escalation they find themselves kidnapped by him. He intends to sneak them into Mexico where they will make meth for the <b>rest of their lives</b>. This is one of the most major stress points in the series. At this point Walter is still convinced that he is cooking meth for the merit of his family and nothing else.(perhaps he is) However, leaving them would be disatouros for Walt. It is non-ideal for Jesse as well of course. The reason I have selected this point as the Nadar of the first few seasons is because it is the real climax and when I believe Walter really becomes hooked to the thrill of cooking meth. With everything at stake and very little to lose. Both Walter and Jesse decide to make a desperate attempt for their lives. They eventually prevail. However, it is shortly thereafter that Hank who had been tracking Jesse shows up at the scene. Walter cannot be found by Hank or his scharade would have been up and it would have been all for not. Walter at this point has been forced into a corner. It is at this moment he makes what is probabbly one of the toughest decisions of the series. One that proves he has learned something...</p><br>

            <img src="assets/imgs/tucougly.jpg" class="scaledimage">
            <i><figcaption>A very unfaltering picture of Tuco Salamanca</figcaption></i>
            </center>

            <p class="articletext">The decision made by Walter is one of the first decision he makes in complete self interest. The moment when he decides to fake a fuge state is the first moment in the series where he forgoes his zealous guise. I dramatize this moment only because it is the first moment in the series where he takes an action that directly <b>harms</b> his family. Walter may be oblivious to the significance of this decision, but it marks a dark moment in the series. He is begging to value his life and buisness over his family. Perhaps I am overdramtic, but from this point forward Walter begins to become significantly more ruthless and unrelenting. Perhaps this is not a bad thing, however, as his ideals decay further ruthlessness turns to <b>cruelty</b> and perhaps even malice.</p><br>



            <br>
            <p class="articletext"> Breaking Bad is an impossibly complex show with thousands of turning moments and small trials. This will not be an all-encompassing website that covers all of them. However I do see three major stages and archs that can be generally represented with just a few major moments. I will be breaking them down in the conclusion section but for now onto the ideal version of Walter White or I suppose Heisenberg.</p>
