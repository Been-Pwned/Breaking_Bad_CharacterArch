            <h2> The First Cooks </h2><br>

            <p class="articletext">Walter(the main character of Breaking Bad) is an exquisite character for the purpose of showing the Heroes Journey. He adapts and evolves throughout the entirety of the series Breaking Bad. His development, however, has a twist throughout the story he becomes more akin to a villain. The way in which the story represents him is intricate and extremely debatable. Therefore, this is simply my interpretation. Some may argue he doesn't become a villain at all, however, the director's camera shots and most viewers' emotions lead me to the conclusion that he does become a villain. So join me as I explain his journey and foretell his future.
                WARNING: SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT</p><br>
            
            <p class="articletext"> Walter White starts as a kindly and affable high school teacher. This would put him in the status quo section of the Heroes Journey. His call to adventure is quite literally a deathly one. His call is a diagnosis of lung cancer. Walter is understandably confused and upset with the world, as he has never smoked a day in his life. This call to adventure will haunt him throughout the series and shape the rest of his life. It is a hallmark for greater things and a calling for him to take control of his life. You see, for most of his life Walter has been pushed around by everyone around him, but with so little runway left he can't allow that to happen anymore...</p><br>
            
            <p class="articletext"> The assistance section of the Heroes Journey is a difficult part of Walt's journey to explain. This is because while he has many people he can rely on, he chooses to refrain from telling anyone of his ailment for quite some time. The majority of his aid comes from his own will forged by necessity. He begins to become bolder and even decides to join Hank, his brother-and-law/An FDA agent, on a call to a house where they are cooking <b>methanphetamine</b>. This is where he finds his true early-series assitance, Jesse Pinkman. However, Walter's journey is a long and arduous one. The only true friend he has for the majority of the series is his money and decaying lifespan. He is a character built of morbid necessity and though his diagnosis of cancer is horrific it is also a primary aspect of his assistance. It is what drives him forward toward a darker path. </p>

            <img src="assets/imgs/earlywalter.jpg" class="scaledimage">
            <i><figcaption> Walter being walked over by his chemistry students.</figcaption></i>
            </center><br>
            
            <p class="articletext"> At this point in the story, Walt is an extremely incompetent criminal. The only thing he knows is chemistry. He must find a way to make money and his course of action to make money is to cook methamphetamine. He uses Jesse as his guide into the criminal underworld. This is where Walter makes his first jump into the "special world".(His departure) His unrivaled skill in chemistry quickly propels him to the forefront of most criminals and even grants him the FDA's attention. Specifically from Hank, his brother-and-law. It is at this point that he faces his first trials and tribulations.</p><br>

            <p class="articletext"> There are many points in the series that are something of a turning point for Walt's identity. One of the most important of these moments happens in the first few episodes. This moment is when he strangles Crazy-8, an early-show antagonist. After a few weeks of holding Crazy-8 in Jesse's basement and burning his friend's body in acid,  Walter is forced to strangle him to survive. This is one of the earliest moments in the series where Walter is forced to consider the harshness of life. Walter as a primarily innocent and well-meaning character must have his moral compass worn down over time. There is no singular moment that breaks him entirely. It is a marathon of moral degradation and realization. That is part of the intrigue of Breaking Bad you watch him change slowly over a few years. This makes it more realistic. Because of this I will only be mentioning many of the most important moments in the series. The ones that change him the most.<p> <br>
            <p class="articletext"> Another primary moment of the first season is when his family attempts to force him to accept cancer treatment. This moment is one of the first moments in the series where he shows himself beginning to gain confidence. His family sits him down shortly after he tells them of his cancer diagnosis and they force him to have a "talk". Skyler is at the forefront of this conversation making use of a "talking pillow". She wants Walter to get treatment at any cost. Walter refuses for one of the first times in his life. He is making a decision. Unfortunatly the family is not fond of this decision and refuses to respect his authority. Based on some facial shots and points of tension in his voice in these scenes he feels betrayed, he fells like his family has turned on him and is trying to force him to do something he doesn't want to do. This is also an early moment in the series when he realizes how little control he has had in the past. For most of the first few seasons, Walter's newfound confidence and  control seem like a beneficial factor. It allows him to defend his kid Walter Jr. and he even begins to value his life more. </p><br>

            </center><br>

            <p class="articletext">Now that some major trials have been represented I will move on to the leading act of a early-series stress point: Jesse is injured by Tuco Salamanca, a deranged drug lord, which forces Walter to confront him. This point and additional points involving Tuco lead up to the Crisis or Nadar of the first few seasons. </p><br>

            <p class="articletext">The major crisis of the first few seasons is one that had major buildup. It is a moment of great importance and tension. Both Jesse and Walter have been looking for a way out of their partnership with Tuco. After many fiascos and large swaths of escalation, they find themselves kidnapped by Tuco. He intends to sneak them into Mexico where they will make meth for the <b>rest of their lives</b>. This is one of the major stress points in the series. In these episodes, Walter is still convinced that he is cooking meth for the merit of his family and nothing else. (perhaps he is) As such, leaving them would be disastrous for Walt. Of course, it is non-ideal for Jesse as well but Walter is the main focus here. The reason I have selected this point as the Nadar of the first few seasons is because it is the first real climax and when it seems that Walter really becomes hooked on the thrill of cooking meth. With everything at stake and very little to lose. Both Walter and Jesse decide to make a desperate attempt for their lives. They eventually prevail. However, it is shortly thereafter that Hank who had been tracking Jesse shows up at the scene. Walter cannot be found by Hank or his charade would be up and it would have all been for not. Walter at this point has been forced into a corner. It is at this moment he makes what is likely one of the toughest decisions in the series. One that proves he has learned something...</p><br>

            <img src="assets/imgs/tucougly.jpg" class="scaledimage">
            <i><figcaption>A very unflatering picture of Tuco Salamanca</figcaption></i>
            </center>

            <p class="articletext">This decision made by Walter is one of the first choices he makes in complete self-interest. The moment when he decides to fake a fugue state is the first moment in the series where he forgoes his zealous guise. I dramatize this moment only because it is the first moment in the series where he takes an action that directly <b>harms</b> his family. Walter may be oblivious to the significance of this decision, but it marks a dark moment in the series. He is begging to value his life and business over his family. Perhaps I am overdramatic, but from this point forward Walter begins to become significantly more ruthless and unrelenting. Perhaps this is not a bad thing, however, as his ideals decay further ruthlessness turns to <b>cruelty</b> and perhaps even malice.</p><br>

            <p class="articletext">His return home is a forced one, as he is no longer able to continue his meth-cooking duties after his "fugue" state. He is held at the hospital and kept constantly under watch by his family and doctors. This forces him to briefly return to the status quo. During this time he is also able to slow his lung cancer. However, this section is not without action, and even though he returns, it will never be the same. His wife begins to suspect things and even questions him while he is medicated. His return is not a heroic one despite his crystal clear and heroic self-image.</p><br>

            <br>
            <p class="articletext"> Breaking Bad is an impossibly complex show with thousands of turning moments and small trials. This will not be an all-encompassing website that covers all of them. I do see three major stages and arcs that can be generally represented with just a few major moments. I will be breaking them down in the conclusion section but for now onto the ideal version of Walter White, or I suppose Heisenberg.</p>

            <h2>The Passage of Time</h2>
            <center>
            <img src="assets/imgs/goodbackground.jpg" class="scaledimage">
            </center>
            <br>
            <p class="articletext">In my humble opinion at this point of the story, Walter is an ideal hero-protagonist character. He is willing to do difficult things, perhaps even morally ambiguous things, but he genuinely believes he is fighting for the greater good. Yes, maybe he isn't perfect maybe he is no longer as innocent as he once was, but he knows what he is doing and where he is going. This section will be dedicated to more ideal aspects of his life as I'm going to lambast him in the following sections. His hypocrisy finds no easily definable bounds. </p><br>

            <p class="articletext">After undergoing several treatments and trials in the first few seasons Walter has become stronger and more assertive. His wife Skyler isn't appeased by this and begins to seek what he has been doing. She has controlled him for most of their relationship and is concerned about his recent emotional developments. This creates a strain on their relationship that will last for the entire series. At this point in the story, Walter is the most in my opinion the most ideal. He will rapidly go back to cooking meth, but at this point, he goes back knowing some harsh truths. After two experiences with bad distributors. He decides to take a stronger do-it-yourself position and asks Jesse to handle distribution. His call to action in this section is the money, enjoyment, thrill, and fulfillment he gets from cooking meth. His departure and assistance are simply his ability to make meth. After his recovery, he once again dives into the criminal underworld.</p><br>

            <p class="articletext">At this point in the series, Walter has become several times more competent than before and is emotionally strong without being totally evil. He is simply making money and doing what he can while he can. The biggest trials at this point in the series are for Jesse. Not to say Walt doesn't evolve, but Walt mostly stays the same only becoming more arrogant throughout the middle sections of the show.</p><br>
            <p class="articletext">It is at this point that Walt has found his calling and is willing to follow it at all costs. He thinks back to when he could have stayed part of a now billion-dollar corporation. His feelings mostly center around not letting that happen again. Most of the issues in this section come with laundering the money and figuring out how to distribute the meth. However, eventually, he decides that he must work with a bigger fish. He goes to his newly made acquaintance Saul Goodman. The lawyer. Saul tells him about a criminal that has been working in distribution for years and is as experienced as they come. He has been concealing his business under the guise of a restaurant chain for years.  This man will be the force that drives most of the rest of the series. At least in the sense of an antagonist.<br> <center class="articletext">That man is Gustavo Fring.</center></p><br>
            <p class="articletext">This is the moment in the series that the second departure <b>really</b> begins. The moment Walter meets Gustavo Fring is probably one of the most significant turning points in the series. It is after this cataclysmic meeting that the series really begins to take off. Eventually, Walter will feel oppressed by Gustavo despite his reasonable deal. Most of the trials are about adapting to new circumstances for Walt. The approach finds itself positioned slightly after the tensions between Walter and Gustavo begin to build. This eventually forces Walt to become increasingly vindictive toward Gustavo. </p><br>

            <i><figcaption>The aformentioned Gustavo Fring</figcaption></i>
            </center>

            <p class="articletext">There are many back-and-forth movements between Gustavo and Walter. Eventually, Walter prevails during their final showdown(the Nadar), but at what cost? It isn't until later that Walter realizes what he has done to get to the point of defeating Gustavo. He poisons children, kills innocents, and in the end has lost what he was fighting for. Perhaps he was never really fighting for anything but his freedom and personal merit. It is at this point that Walter begins to return to the status quo. At least as close as he can come to it. </p><br>
            <p class="articletext">It is only on his return to the status quo that Walter realizes the error in his ways, but it is too late. As such in a selfish or perhaps simply understanding move he accepts his true motives and objective. He comes back to the status quo an entirely different person. Unfortunately, he comes back a worse version of what he once was. When he returns it is once again not as a hero, but as a broken man turned to evil out of desperation and a sense of self-preservation. But at least, he understands himself and is no longer maintaining his delusionary facade of zealous motives. For better or for worse at least he accepts himself... </p><br>

            <h1>A Reckoning to Be Remembered By</h1>

            <img src="assets/imgs/cooktime.jpg" class="scaledimage">
            <i><figcaption>Walter White and Jesse ready to cook</figcaption></i>
            </center><br>
            <p class="articletext">Walter has changed much over his journey and is ready to embark on a last cycle of the Heroes Journey. However with the loss of his family's trust and even Jesse's partnership. (I skipped a little bit) He finds himself in a scenario where the status quo and the "special world" have reversed. His previously family-focused life has turned into nothing but criminal work. He has become a kingpin in the criminal world and yet most of his problematic trials rest with his family. His empire has become his only solace, everyone he once loved has left him or been killed. His family? Unforgiving never to be mended. With good reason too. He has become a monster in every sense of the word. His darker characteristics have been amplified to the maximum and any remnants of his previously affable consciousness are all but naught. </p><br>
            <p class="articletext">After some exciting moments and brief tension points, Walter is forced to a cabin on a mountain while things "cool down". This is where the last of his former self is eradicated. Even his former arrogant, selfish, persona is gone. He becomes cold and hardened much like the environment around him. Leaving him nothing but his desires. It is when he drops past the proverbial rock bottom and becomes worn down by his isolation that he decides to leave. There is nothing left but a goal and an empty shell of a person. It is only then that he does one of his first truly selfless acts since the series began.</p><br>
            <p class="articletext">Walt now has total control over almost everything in his life, but he feels empty. It is then that he makes his departure back to his home and watches the remainder of his family for a brief few moments before continuing to "tie up some loose ends". This is when the Nadar of Walter's third stage presents itself. There is very little buildup to it, however, it is my favorite Nadar of the series. It could never be presented without the amazing writing, acting, and camera work used throughout the show. It is the moment that he stands over his wife Skyler to speak with her. This is the harshest moment for him because it is him realizes the status quo he has lost. This is perhaps my favorite moment in the series. It could never be brought to words.(So I will show you look bellow.)</p><br>

            <i><figcaption>Before this scene it appears as if Skyler is alone, but the camera zooms in to show Walt standing over her like a villain.</figcaption></i>
            </center><br>

            <p class="articletext">It is after this scene, and an almost as heart-wrenchingly spooky scene where he watches his son, that the Nadar is truly over and his return begins. Unlike the times when he was dragged back to what was once his status quo, he fittingly returns to the criminal world with open arms. He is able to take out a troubling group of enemies with relative ease and he finds himself back where he is most comfortable. His return is an extremely intricate and interesting one that is displayed over relatively few episodes, but they are some of the most dense episodes in the entire series. (which makes everything that much better)</p><br>
            <p class="articletext">He returns completely accepting of himself and understanding what he has become. It is in the last few episodes that he regains his selflessness. The actions that return him are the hinges that close the door on the series and as such shall be left undisclosed. Walter ends the series among all the things that brought him there. He ends up surrounded by the things that brought him all he could have ever wanted and gave him the strength he always wished he had. He is surrounded by his life's work and legacy. His virtuous motives and excuses are long gone. It is only him, his ambition, and his lab. </p><br>

            <h1>To Wrap it Up With a Bow</h1><br>

            <p class="articletext">The sequence and rate at which the Breaking Bad series plays out is perfectly done. The pacing of the show seems almost mystical. It is the perfect storm of well-made components that has brought this show success and well deserved success as that. This conclusion, however, is not dedicated to me raving about the show. I will speak my mind on some of the biggest turning points, patterns, and interesting tidbits that I noticed in the show.</p><br>
            <p class="articletext">Most of Walter's deterioration occurs after Gustavo's death. I always found this interesting because you would think that most of it happened before, but it didn't. I think this reflects how competitive natures can influence us without us realizing it until it is too late.(which can also be a good thing) Also, I believe that Breaking Bad is a lesson on how life-endangering experiences change us. We all value things but what will we do to survive? Will we breach our moral code to live and prosper, or will we stick by it to the last breath? Most of Breaking Bad boils down to that question.</p><br>
            <p class="articletext">Now that I have mentioned some of my thoughts on the series I will conclude this article. My entire concept can be summed up into a few points: There are three major arcs that Walter follows, they each represent a Heroes Journey cycle on their own, and Breaking Bad is way too complex for a few week-long project to do justice to. If I really wanted to I could go episode by episode with the Heroes Journey and It would be just as easy to fit into the Heroes Journey as looking at the entire story. Breaking Bad is great. Watch it if you haven't.</p><br>
