            The third where I describe his heroes journey at the height of his criminal activity.
            The fourth where I describe my thoughts on whether he is a villain and why I think he does what he does.
            -->
            <h2> The First Cooks </h2><br>

            <p class="articletext">Walter is an exquiste character for the purpose of showing the heroes journey. He adapts and evolves throughout the entirety of the series Breaking Bad. His development however, has a twist throughout the story he becomes more akin to a villain. The way in which the story represents him is intricate and extremely debatable. Therefore, this is simply my interpretation. Some may argue he doesn't become a villain at all, however the directors casting and most viewers emotions lead me the conclusion that he does. So join me as I explain his journey and fortell his future.<br> WARNING: SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT</p><br>
            
            <p class="articletext"> Walter White most certainly starts as a kindly and afable high school teacher. This would put him in the status quo section of the heroes journey. His call to adventure is quite literally a deathly one. His call is a diagnosis of lung cancer. Walter is understandably confused and upset with the world, as he has never smoked a day in his life. This call to adventure will haunt him throughout the series and shape the rest of his life. It is a hallmark for greater things and a calling for him to take control of his life. You see, for most of his life Walter has been pushed around by everyone around him, but with so little runway left he can't allow that to happen anymore...</p><br>
            
            <p class="articletext"> The assitance section of the heroes journey is a difficult part of Walt's journey to explain. This is because while he has many people he can rely on, he chooses to refrain from telling anyone of his ailment for quite some time. The majority of his aid comes from his own will forged by necessity. He begins to become bolder and even decides to join Hank on a call to a house where they are cooking <b>methanphetamine</b>. This is where he finds his true early-series assitance, Jesse Pinkman. However, Walter's journey is a long and ardous one. The only true friend he has for the majority of the series is his money and decaying lifespan. He is a character built of necessity and though his diagnosis of cancer is horrific it is also a primary aspect of his assitance. It is what drives him forward towards a darker path. </p>

            </center><br>
            
            <p class="articletext"> At this point in the story Walt is an extremely incompetent criminal. The only thing he knows is chemistry. He must find a way to make money and his course of action to do this is to cook methanphetamine. He uses Jesse as his guide into the criminal underworld. This is where Walter makes his first jump into the "special world". </p>
